ECSP Server - Installation
====================================================


From Sources - Linux
====================

You need CMake from <http://www.cmake.org> for configuring server.

If you need/want to tweak build a bit more than configure wrapper
provides, you have to use CMake directly. For now, only out of source
build is supported, so you have to create separate directory for build:

> mkdir build
> cd build

Then just configure project:

> cmake ..

Build it:

> make

Test that everything is okay:

> make test

And finally install it:

> sudo make install

You can configure build parameters either by command line (see
parameters bellow), or using TUI - ccmake.

Useful cmake parameters:

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" enables debug build
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" change installation prefix
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="~/libs" path to third party libraries
